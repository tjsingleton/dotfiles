# TODO

## Work Configuration
- [ ] Create separate work configuration file (e.g., `.work-profile` or `.work-aliases`)
- [ ] Move work-specific settings out of main dotfiles
- [x] Set up proper environment detection for work vs personal settings

## Current Status
- âœ… Dotfiles installed and linked via Homesick
- âœ… Oh My Zsh configured with sunaku theme
- âœ… Vim plugins installed (ctrlp, nerdcommenter, fugitive, repeat, surround)
- âœ… asdf Ruby 3.4.4 configured and working
- âœ… Latest dotfiles pulled from work computer
- âœ… asdf initialization added to .profile
- âœ… Environment detection implemented for work-specific settings
- âœ… Shell configuration loads without errors
- âœ… New terminal window working perfectly with all configurations
- âœ… Git pager disabled when Cursor is detected
- âœ… Cursor-specific editor optimizations implemented
- âœ… All changes committed and pushed to remote repository

## Completed Tasks
1. âœ… Fixed asdf path in .profile
2. âœ… Added environment detection for .ih/augment.sh in .zshrc
3. âœ… Shell configuration now loads successfully
4. âœ… Tested in new terminal window - everything working!
5. âœ… Identified exit code 1 behavior (normal for conditional at end of script)
6. âœ… Updated Oh My Zsh to latest version
7. âœ… Added git pager disable when Cursor is detected
8. âœ… Successfully resolved merge conflicts during rebase
9. âœ… Pushed all changes to remote repository
10. âœ… Implemented Cursor-specific editor optimizations (nano instead of vim)

## Installation Complete! ðŸŽ‰
Your dotfiles are now fully installed and working on your personal machine. All core functionality is operational:
- Oh My Zsh with sunaku theme (updated to latest version)
- asdf Ruby 3.4.4
- Vim with plugins
- All aliases and configurations
- Work-specific settings only load when appropriate
- Git pager disabled in Cursor for better UX
- Cursor-specific editor optimizations (nano for git operations)
- All changes successfully committed and pushed

## Note on Exit Code
The `source ~/.zshrc` command returns exit code 1 because the last line is a conditional `[ -f "$HOME/.ih/augment.sh" ] && . "$HOME/.ih/augment.sh"` that evaluates to false (file doesn't exist). This is normal behavior and doesn't indicate an error - the configuration loads successfully.

## Cursor Optimizations
When Cursor is detected (`CURSOR_SESSION_ID` is set), the following optimizations are applied:
- **Git Pager**: Disabled (`GIT_PAGER=""`) for better UX in Cursor
- **Editor**: Set to `nano` instead of `vim` for git operations to avoid display issues
- **Git Editor**: Explicitly set to `nano` for git commit/rebase operations
- **Visual Editor**: Set to `nano` as fallback

This provides a much better experience when working with git operations in Cursor, avoiding the vim display issues and pager interface.
