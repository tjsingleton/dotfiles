## Testing Checklist (Latest Changes)
- [x] Test new GP (GlobalProtect) functions: gp-start, gp-stop
- [x] Test kubectl node describe alias: kdn
- [x] Test JWT decode function: jwt-decode
- [x] Verify shell initialization works correctly

## Work Configuration (Optional Future Improvements)
- [ ] Create separate work configuration file (e.g., `.work-profile` or `.work-aliases`)

7. âœ… Added git pager disable when Cursor is detected
8. âœ… Successfully resolved merge conflicts during rebase
9. âœ… Pushed all changes to remote repository
10. âœ… Implemented Cursor-specific editor optimizations (nano instead of vim)
11. âœ… Added comprehensive error handling with fail-fast behavior
12. âœ… Implemented debug logging system for troubleshooting
13. âœ… Fixed work-specific aliases to use environment detection
14. âœ… Updated documentation and TODO list
15. âœ… Added new shell functions (GP start/stop, kubectl node describe, JWT decode)
16. âœ… Fixed zsh prompt error messages
17. âœ… Fixed shell exit on command failure (removed set -e from .profile)
18. âœ… Added back Oh My Zsh plugins incrementally (git, brew, gem, macos)
19. âœ… Created comprehensive README.md documentation
20. âœ… Implemented testing framework (test_dotfiles.sh, test_runner.sh, TESTING.md)

## Installation Complete! ðŸŽ‰
Your dotfiles are now fully installed and working on your personal machine. All core functionality is operational:
- Oh My Zsh with sunaku theme (updated to latest version)
- asdf Ruby 3.4.4
- Vim with plugins
- All aliases and configurations
- Work-specific settings only load when appropriate
- Git pager disabled in Cursor for better UX
- Cursor-specific editor optimizations (nano for git operations)
- Comprehensive error handling and debug logging
- All changes successfully committed and pushed
- New shell functions for VPN management, kubectl operations, and JWT decoding
- Clean zsh prompt without error messages

## Error Handling Features
The dotfiles now include comprehensive error handling:
- **Fail-Fast Behavior**: Scripts exit immediately on any error (`set -euo pipefail`)
- **Debug Logging**: Verbose output when `DOTFILES_DEBUG=1` is set
- **Error Messages**: Clear error messages for failed operations
- **Environment Detection**: Work-specific settings only load when appropriate
- **Safe Sourcing**: All source operations include error checking

## Note on Exit Code
The `source ~/.zshrc` command returns exit code 1 because the last line is a conditional `[ -f "$HOME/.ih/augment.sh" ] && . "$HOME/.ih/augment.sh"` that evaluates to false (file doesn't exist). This is normal behavior and doesn't indicate an error - the configuration loads successfully.

## Cursor Optimizations
When Cursor is detected (`CURSOR_SESSION_ID` is set), the following optimizations are applied:
- **Git Pager**: Disabled (`GIT_PAGER=""`) for better UX in Cursor
- **Editor**: Set to `nano` instead of `vim` for git operations to avoid display issues
- **Git Editor**: Explicitly set to `nano` for git commit/rebase operations
- **Visual Editor**: Set to `nano` as fallback

This provides a much better experience when working with git operations in Cursor, avoiding the vim display issues and pager interface.

## New Shell Functions Added
- **gp-start**: Start GlobalProtect VPN service
- **gp-stop**: Stop GlobalProtect VPN service  
- **kdn**: Alias for `kubectl describe node`
- **jwt-decode**: Function to decode JWT tokens

## Next Steps (Optional)
The dotfiles are production-ready and fully functional. The remaining tasks are optional organizational improvements:
1. **Separate work configuration**: Move work-specific settings to dedicated files
2. **Clean up main dotfiles**: Extract work configurations for cleaner structure

These can be tackled later if desired, but the current implementation is complete and working perfectly.
