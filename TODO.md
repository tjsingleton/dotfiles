# TODO

## Work Configuration
- [ ] Create separate work configuration file (e.g., `.work-profile` or `.work-aliases`)
- [ ] Move work-specific settings out of main dotfiles
- [x] Set up proper environment detection for work vs personal settings

## Current Status
- âœ… Dotfiles installed and linked via Homesick
- âœ… Oh My Zsh configured with sunaku theme
- âœ… Vim plugins installed (ctrlp, nerdcommenter, fugitive, repeat, surround)
- âœ… asdf Ruby 3.4.4 configured and working
- âœ… Latest dotfiles pulled from work computer
- âœ… asdf initialization added to .profile
- âœ… Environment detection implemented for work-specific settings
- âœ… Shell configuration loads without errors
- âœ… New terminal window working perfectly with all configurations
- âœ… Git pager disabled when Cursor is detected

## Completed Tasks
1. âœ… Fixed asdf path in .profile
2. âœ… Added environment detection for .ih/augment.sh in .zshrc
3. âœ… Shell configuration now loads successfully
4. âœ… Tested in new terminal window - everything working!
5. âœ… Identified exit code 1 behavior (normal for conditional at end of script)
6. âœ… Updated Oh My Zsh to latest version
7. âœ… Added git pager disable when Cursor is detected

## Next Steps
1. âœ… Test shell configuration in a new terminal window (COMPLETED)
2. Create separate work configuration file (future task)
3. Add environment detection for other work-specific settings in .profile and .aliases

## Installation Complete! ðŸŽ‰
Your dotfiles are now fully installed and working on your personal machine. All core functionality is operational:
- Oh My Zsh with sunaku theme (updated to latest version)
- asdf Ruby 3.4.4
- Vim with plugins
- All aliases and configurations
- Work-specific settings only load when appropriate
- Git pager disabled in Cursor for better UX

## Note on Exit Code
The `source ~/.zshrc` command returns exit code 1 because the last line is a conditional `[ -f "$HOME/.ih/augment.sh" ] && . "$HOME/.ih/augment.sh"` that evaluates to false (file doesn't exist). This is normal behavior and doesn't indicate an error - the configuration loads successfully.
