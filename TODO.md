## Installation Complete! ðŸŽ‰
Your dotfiles are now fully installed and working on your personal machine. All core functionality is operational:
- Oh My Zsh with robbyrussell theme (latest version, clean repository)
- asdf Ruby 3.4.4
- Vim with plugins
- All aliases and configurations
- Work-specific settings only load when appropriate
- Git pager disabled in Cursor for better UX
- Cursor-specific editor optimizations (nano for git operations)
- Comprehensive error handling and debug logging
- All changes successfully committed and pushed
- New shell functions for VPN management, kubectl operations, and JWT decoding
- Clean zsh prompt without error messages
- No more "no matches found" errors during shell startup

## Error Handling Features
The dotfiles now include comprehensive error handling:
- **Fail-Fast Behavior**: Scripts exit immediately on any error (`set -euo pipefail`)
- **Debug Logging**: Verbose output when `DOTFILES_DEBUG=1` is set
- **Error Messages**: Clear error messages for failed operations
- **Environment Detection**: Work-specific settings only load when appropriate
- **Safe Sourcing**: All source operations include error checking
- **Robust Globbing**: Using `find` instead of glob expansion to prevent "no matches found" errors

## Note on Exit Code
The `source ~/.zshrc` command returns exit code 1 because the last line is a conditional `[ -f "$HOME/.ih/augment.sh" ] && . "$HOME/.ih/augment.sh"` that evaluates to false (file doesn't exist). This is normal behavior and doesn't indicate an error - the configuration loads successfully.

## Cursor Optimizations
When Cursor is detected (`CURSOR_SESSION_ID` is set), the following optimizations are applied:
- **Git Pager**: Disabled (`GIT_PAGER=""`) for better UX in Cursor
- **Editor**: Set to `cursor` instead of `vim` for git operations to avoid display issues
- **Git Editor**: Explicitly set to `cursor` for git commit/rebase operations
- **Visual Editor**: Set to `cursor` as fallback

This provides a much better experience when working with git operations in Cursor, avoiding the vim display issues and pager interface.

## New Shell Functions Added
- **gp-start**: Start GlobalProtect VPN service
- **gp-stop**: Stop GlobalProtect VPN service  
- **kdn**: Alias for `kubectl describe node`
- **jwt-decode**: Function to decode JWT tokens

## Oh My Zsh Status
- **Version**: Latest (commit 5c804257)
- **Theme**: robbyrussell (stable, default theme)
- **Plugins**: git, brew, gem, macos (all working perfectly)
- **Repository**: Clean and up to date with official repo
- **Custom themes**: Removed unused custom themes (minimal.zsh-theme, sunaku-fixed.zsh-theme)

## Testing Framework
- **33 comprehensive tests** covering all aspects of dotfiles functionality
- **Startup error detection** to catch shell initialization issues
- **Homesick conflict detection** to ensure proper symlink management
- **All tests passing** - dotfiles are production-ready

## Next Steps (Optional)
The dotfiles are production-ready and fully functional. The remaining tasks are optional organizational improvements:
1. **Separate work configuration**: Move work-specific settings to dedicated files
2. **Clean up main dotfiles**: Extract work configurations for cleaner structure
3. **Add more Oh My Zsh plugins**: docker, kubectl, aws, terraform
4. **Customize the prompt**: Create a custom Oh My Zsh theme

These can be tackled later if desired, but the current implementation is complete and working perfectly.
